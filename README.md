# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM Neural Networks

This repository contains code for predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.

## Description

This project aims to forecast stock prices for various companies using LSTM neural networks. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is well-suited for time series prediction tasks due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python (version 3.x)
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd stock-price-prediction

3. Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt


### Usage

#### Data Preparation:

- Place your historical stock price data files (CSV format) in the `data` directory.
- Ensure that each CSV file contains at least two columns: `Date` and `Adj. Close` (adjusted closing price).

#### Model Training:

- Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script corresponding to the dataset you want to train the model on (e.g., `train_amazon.ipynb` or `train_amazon.py`).
- Follow the instructions provided in the notebook/script to train the LSTM model.
- The trained model will be saved to the `models` directory.

#### Prediction:

- After training the model, open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for generating predictions (e.g., `predict_amazon.ipynb` or `predict_amazon.py`).
- Follow the instructions provided to load the trained model and generate predictions for future stock prices.
- The predicted prices will be saved to the `predictions` directory.
